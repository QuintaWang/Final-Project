# Final Project
# Title
## Differential Gene Expression in Different age Using DeSEQ2
# Author
## Jiaxin Wang
# Overview of Project
## I will identify differentially expressed genes between primary tumor for female age under 55 vs age over 55. This analysis will utilize the package DeSEQ2 (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html) and complete the entire vignette. For this analysis, Iâ€™ll utilize the TCGA cohort, and have identified STAR files for tumors that fit within my cohort with 90 female under age of 55 and 138 female above age of 55. Within the analysis, I will control for race and ethnicity. 

## Vignette: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html

# Data
## I will use the data from https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository. Examining clinical data, there are 228 primary tumor samples, and 90 are defined by me as young patient and 138 are identified as senior patient. The specific files are available are here [link].
# Milestone 1
## I will start by input data into tximport and start graph MA-plot.
# Milestone 2
# Deliverable
## R MarkDown
